# KiCad projects

- Add `./Libraries/74xx-Computer-Symbols.lib` as global Symbol library to KiCad (Eeschema)
- Add `./Libraries` as global Footprint library to KiCad (Pcbnew)
- PCBs are initially autorouted using `./Libraries/freeRouting.jar`

## TODO

- ALU - PCB error: LED bar graph for AX (_BAR1_) and AY (_BAR2_) have swapped places on the PCB
- Clock - Bigger tact switch for step
