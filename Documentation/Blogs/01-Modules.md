# Modules

I'm documenting all the modules for the TTL Computer in a serie of blog posts.  
Most modules will be described in two posts:

- **Part I**: General description of the module with initial architectual and circuit diagram.  
While writing these posts, the circuits have not been built on breadboard yet so they are untested.
- **Part II**: Additional post after the circuit has been tested on a breadboard.  
This will describe changes that were made based on the tests.

These posts are meant as a form of documentation for myself and for anyone who is following this build.
